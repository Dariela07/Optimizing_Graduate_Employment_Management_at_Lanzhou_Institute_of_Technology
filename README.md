# Optimizing_graduate_employment_management_at_Lanzhou_Institute_of_Technology
This project optimizes the graduate employment data management process by consulting its former employee. It proposes digital transformation, draws BPMN diagrams (As-Is and To-Be), conducts a cost impact analysis, and designs automated pipelines using GitLab for data collection. The solution cuts costs by 67% and achieves break-even in under two years, improving overall accuracy and efficiency.

It includes a presentation slide introducing the project. (Full project details and BPMN diagrams are available upon request.)
